You don't want sensitive information (confidential information, passwords, API keys, access tokens, key combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel, Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.

**Use this service in case you want toâ€¦**
- Share your Netflix password with a family member.
- Send a private message from a public computer.
- Send access tokens, API keys, PIN codes to a friend or coworker.
- Forward payment information such as credit card number or Bitcoin wallet address.
- Confess to a secret crush.
- Transmit information that could be used against you.`,
