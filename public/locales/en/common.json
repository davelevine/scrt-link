You don't want sensitive information (confidential information, passwords, API keys, access tokens, key combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel, Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.\n\n**Use this service in case you want toâ€¦**\n- Share your Netflix password with a family member.\n- Send a private message from a public computer.\n- Send access tokens, API keys, PIN codes to a coworker.\n- Confess to a secret crush.\n- Transmit information that could be used against you."

    "who": {
      "heading": "Who is it for?",
      "body": "Essentially everybody. Everybody should care about privacy.  \n  The means to transmit sensitive information anonymously is especially crucial for journalists, lawyers, politicians, whistleblowers, people who are being oppressed, etc."
    },
    "how": {
      "heading": "How does the service work?",
      "body": "After you submit the form your secret will be encrypted and stored. You can now share the generated short link via text message, email or whatever service you trust. (We recommend Signal, Threema or Matrix.) After the recipients clicks the link, the message gets displayed and permanently removed from the database. \n    \nFor **extra security**, you can include a password that will be needed to decrypt the message. (We recommend to share the password via a different channel than the link.)"

      "body": "Anonymity and security. Plain text messages within a chat log can always get traced back to you. With scrt.link you will always just have a link in your conversation history. After the link has been visited once, it will lead to a 404 error page. There is no way of accessing the original content."

      "heading": "What is the difference to Snapchat?",
      "body": "Same answer as for the previous question. Also, the business model behind Snapchat, and every other major social media platform, contradicts the idea of privacy and anonymity.

The idea grew into a project that could be summarized as \"Sharing secrets as a service\". There are similar products out there - in fact, some have been a great inspiration. However, what sets scrt.link apart is the combination of all the great ideas and concepts around security and privacy, with the attention on design and user experience.
