Sharing secrets is delicate. You don't want sensitive information (confidential information, passwords, access tokens, key combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel, Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.

**Use this service in case you want toâ€¦**
- Share your Netflix password with a family member.
- Send a private message from a public computer.
- Confess to a secret crush.
- Transmit information that could be used against you.

After you submit the form your secret will be encrypted and stored. You can now share the generated short link via text message, email or whatever service you trust. (We recommend Signal, Threema or Matrix.) After the recipients clicks the link, the message gets displayed and permanently removed from the database. 
    
For **extra security**, you can include a password that will be needed to decrypt the message. (We recommend to share the password via a different channel than the link.)`,

  The means to transmit sensitive information anonymously is especially crucial for journalists, lawyers, politicians, whistleblowers, people who are being oppressed, etc.
