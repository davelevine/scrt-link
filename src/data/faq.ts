Sharing secrets is delicate. You don't want sensitive information (confidential information, passwords, API keys, access tokens, key combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel, Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.

**Use this service in case you want toâ€¦**
- Share your Netflix password with a family member.
- Send a private message from a public computer.
- Send access tokens, API keys, PIN codes to a coworker.
- Confess to a secret crush.
- Transmit information that could be used against you.

After you submit the form your secret will be encrypted and stored. You can now share the generated short link via text message, email or whatever service you trust. (We recommend Signal, Threema or Matrix.) After the recipients clicks the link, the message gets displayed and permanently removed from the database. 
    
For **extra security**, you can include a password that will be needed to decrypt the message. (We recommend to share the password via a different channel than the link.)`,

There are many scenarios where even disappearing messages are a risk factor: Do other people have access to your phone sometimes? What if you lost your phone?

- Connect to our service via a virtual private network (VPN): This way you never expose your personal IP address. We recommend [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

This means that the secret link has already been visited. If this happens unexpectedly:
- Check with the sender to make sure the link hasn't been visited by mistake.
- The secret was accessed via brut-force attack or there is an issue with the server infrastructure (don't worry, the contents of the secrets would still be encrypted) - both cases are very unlikely.
- **Worst case**: A third party accessed the link, which ultimately means, your communication channel and/or either party's device has been compromised.
