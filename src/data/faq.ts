Sharing secrets is delicate. You don't want sensitive information (confidential information, passwords, API keys, access tokens, key combinations, confessions, etc.) to stay in your Slack channel, Whatsapp chat log, inbox, or any other communication channel. A one-time disposable link guarantees that your secret is only viewed exactly once, before being permanently destroyed.

**Use this service in case you want toâ€¦**
- Share your Netflix password with a family member.
- Send a private message from a public computer.
- Confess to a secret crush.
- Transmit information that could be used against you.

    id: 'who',

  The means to transmit sensitive information anonymously is especially crucial for journalists, lawyers, politicians, whistleblowers, people who are being oppressed, etc.

After you submit the form your secret will be encrypted and stored. You can now share the generated short link via text message, email or whatever service you trust. (We recommend Signal, Threema or Matrix.) After the recipients clicks the link, the message gets displayed and permanently removed from the database. 
    
For **extra security**, you can include a password that will be needed to decrypt the message. (We recommend to share the password via a different channel than the link.)`,

    heading: `What is the difference to disappearing messages on Signal or Whatsapp?`,
    body: `Anonymity, privacy and security. Plain text messages within a chat log can always get tracked back to you. There are many scenarios where even disappearing messages are a risk factor: Do other people have access to your phone sometimes? What if you lost your phone? Or even worse, your phone might be compromised on an operating system level.  With scrt.link you will always just have a link in your conversation history. After the link has been visited once, it will lead to a 404 error page. There is no way of accessing the original content.

However, it is fine to share a generated secret link using Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, etc.

[Demo](${demoSecretMessageLink})

- **Neogramâ„¢**: Digital letter-style message that automatically burns after reading. Use it for confidential notes, confessions or secret love letters. [Demo](${demoSecretNeogramLink})

We take a number of steps to protect your privacy, detailed on the [privacy page](/privacy) - however some of the features require third party services that may have access to personal identifiable information (PII). If you want to further protect your privacy, we recommend following steps:

- Connect to our service via a virtual private network (VPN): This way you never expose your personal IP address. We recommend [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).
- Use masked emails and phone numbers: If you choose to create an account, you can use a service such as [Abine Blur](https://www.abine.com/) to hide your personal email address, phone number and/or credit card information.
