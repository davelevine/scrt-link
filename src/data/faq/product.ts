For each secret, we generate a Secret ID (a random string) which is the only reference to the original message. Once the recipient opens the secret link, we notify you using the chosen method. In the notification we only include the Secret ID - so be sure to store/remember it. Needless to say, the contact information (email or phone number) is **never exposed to the recipient**.

**Email**: You'll receive an email from *${email}*.

**SMS**: You'll receive an SMS notification from *${twilioSenderPhoneNumber}*.

This means that the secret link has already been visited. If this happens unexpectedly:
- Check with the sender to make sure the link hasn't been visited by mistake.
- The secret was accessed via brut-force attack or there is an issue with the server infrastructure (don't worry, the contents of the secrets would still be encrypted) - both cases are very unlikely.
- **Worst case**: A third party accessed the link, which ultimately means, your communication channel and/or either party's device has been compromised.

_**Important notice:** There are limitations when using the Slack Application. Due to the nature of how these apps are designed, full end-to-end encryption is not possible. In most cases this is not a problem and a risk worth taking - however, if you need advanced protection, create secrets on the website instead._
