    body: `The honest answer: We can't know for sure. It's important to understand that **end-to-end-encryption is not possible** with Slack apps. However, the communication between our app server and Slack is encrypted and we therefore believe that for 99% of use cases it's safe to use. Still, please be aware that **Slack is proprietary software** and we don't have control over code that runs your Slack instance. **In case you need to be 100% sure, create secrets via the website instead.**`,

    body: `Short answer: Don't. That said, we believe in trust through transparency. While you might have something to hide, we don't. That's why all code is open source and available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/kingchiller/scrt-link-slack). Feel free to launch your own private Slack App.`,
