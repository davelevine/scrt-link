However, the communication between our app server and Slack is encrypted and we therefore believe that for 99% of use cases it's safe to use. Still, please be aware that **Slack is proprietary software** and we don't have control over code that runs your Slack instance. **In case you need to be 100% sure, create secrets via the website instead.**`,
